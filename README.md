# Florisboard_RGB_Seasonal_Themes

I decided to make a few themes for the Florisboard keyboard a while ago, and now I have decided to publish them.

## Manual Install
- Download the .flex file.
- Open the FlorisBoard app.
- Click Addons & Extensions.
- Click Import.
- Select the downloaded .flex file.
- After making sure you can see the themes, click Import.
- At the main menu, click Theme, and choose the theme you want to use.
